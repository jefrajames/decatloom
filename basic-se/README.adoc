== Java SE benchmark

A basic Java SE benchmark comparing Platform and Virtual Threads performance.

The goal is to determine whether VT are really faster, cheaper and lighter than PT.

[source,sh]

# To package the project
mvn package

# To run with Platform Threads
./runPT.sh <nb of threads>

# To run with Virtual Threads
./runVT.sh <nb of Threads>

== Findings


* No more than 4096 Platform Threads on macOS (see num_taskthreads system parameter)
* Up to 64 millions Virtual Threads
* Using 8 Carrier Threads
* ~ 200 VT started/ms
* Linear memory footprint
* ~ 1 KB/VT
